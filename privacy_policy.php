This Privacy Notice describes how Phone Guru and its affiliates collect and process your personal information through our websites, devices, products, services, online stores, and applications that reference this Privacy Notice. By using our Services, you are consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                <p class="font-baloo font-size-20">To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookies Notice .</p>
                <p class="font-baloo font-size-20">We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
                <p class="font-baloo font-size-20">We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already bought one of our products, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to buy that product again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers.</p>
